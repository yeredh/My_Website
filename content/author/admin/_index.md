I am a research fellow in CZ Zhang's lab at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in the Department of Data Sciences. My research interests lie in the effects of copy number alterations on gene expression, integrating curated gene sets to better interpret gene expression data, and methods to compare gene expression data across different species. 

I received my PhD in the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard University where I was advised by [Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.github.io/) and [Winston Hide](https://hsci.harvard.edu/people/winston-hide-phd).
